    # (Optional) techdocs.generator.pullImage can be used to disable pulling the latest docker image by default. This can be useful when you are
    # using a custom techdocs.generator.dockerImage and you have a custom docker login requirement. For example, you need to login to
    # AWS ECR to pull the docker image.
    # NOTE: Disabling this requires the docker image was pulled by other means before running the techdocs generator.
